The primary outcome was the mean reduction of the timespent in a relatively immobile ‘off’ phase (mean off-time),calculated in hours per day. Relative treatment effects wereexpressed as mean difference. Data on this outcome were availablefor 5,331 patients from 28 studies comparing an active treatmentwith placebo and one three-arm study comparing two activetreatments with placebo."],"concepts":["medicine"," raw mean differences"," network meta-analysis"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Stowe, R., Ives, N., Clarke, C. E., Deane, K., Hilten, V.,Wheatley, K., Gray, R., Handley, K., & Furmston, A.
