{"id":["dat.molloy2014"],"title":["Studies on the Relationship between Conscientiousness and Medication Adherence"],"display_title":[""],"description":["Results from 16 studies on the correlation betweenconscientiousness and medication adherence."],"details":["Conscientiousness, one of the big-5 personality traits, can bedefined as “socially prescribed impulse control that facilitatestask- and goal-directed behaviour, such as thinking before acting,delaying gratification, following norms and rules and planning,organising and prioritising tasks” (John & Srivastava, 1999).Conscientiousness has been shown to be related to a number ofhealth-related behaviors (e.g., tobacco/alcohol/drug use, diet andactivity patterns, risky behaviors). A recent meta-analysis byMolloy et al. (2014) examined to what extent conscientiousness isrelated to medication adherence, that is, the extent to which(typically chronically ill) patients follow a prescribedmedication regimen (e.g., taking a daily dose of a cholesterollowering drug in patients with high LDL serum cholesterol levels).The results from the 16 studies included in this meta-analysis areprovided in this dataset.Variable ‘a_measure’ indicates whether adherence was measuredbased on self-reports or a more ‘objective’ measure (e.g.,electronic monitoring of pill bottle openings, pill counts).Variable ‘c_measure’ indicates whether conscientiousness wasmeasured with some version of the NEO personality inventory orsome other scale. Methodological quality was scored by the authorson a 1 to 4 scale with higher scores indicating higher quality(see article for details on how this score was derived)."],"concepts":["psychology"," medicine"," correlation coefficients"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Molloy, G.
