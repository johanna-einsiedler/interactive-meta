Reported outcomes include thechange in probing depth (PD) and attachment level (AL) one yearafter the treatment. The outcome measure used for thismeta-analysis was the (raw) mean difference, calculated in such away that positive values indicate that surgery was more effectivethan non-surgical treatment in decreasing the probing depth andincreasing the attachment level (so, the results from the varioustrials indicate that surgery is preferable for reducing theprobing depth, while non-surgical treatment is preferable forincreasing the attachment level). Since each trial provides effectsize estimates for both outcomes, the estimates are correlated. Amultivariate model can be used to meta-analyze the two outcomessimultaneously.The ‘v1i’ and ‘v2i’ values are the variances and covariances ofthe observed effects. In particular, for each study, variables‘v1i’ and ‘v2i’ form a 2x2 variance-covariance matrix of theobserved effects, with the diagonal elements corresponding to thesampling variances of the mean differences (the first for probingdepth, the second for attachment level) and the off-diagonal valuecorresponding to the covariance of the two mean differences.Below, the full (block diagonal) variance-covariance for allstudies is constructed from these two variables."],"concepts":["medicine"," dentistry"," raw mean differences"," multivariate models"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Berkey, C.
