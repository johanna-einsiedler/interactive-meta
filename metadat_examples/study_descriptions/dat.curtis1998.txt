The ‘co2.ambi’ and ‘co2.elev’ variablesindicate the CO2 levels in the control and treatment groups,respectively (with the ‘units’ variable specifying the units forthe CO2 exposure levels). Many of the studies also varied one ormore additional environmental variables (defined by the ‘xtrt’ and‘level’ variables):• NONE = no additional treatment factor• FERT = soil fertility (either a ‘CONTROL’, ‘HIGH’, or ‘LOW’level)• LIGHT = light treatment (always a ‘LOW’ light level)• FERT+L = soil fertility and light (a ‘LOW’ light and soilfertility level)• H2O = well watered vs drought (either a ‘WW’ or ‘DRT’ level)• TEMP = temperature treatment (either a ‘HIGH’ or ‘LOW’ level)• OZONE = ozone exposure (either a ‘HIGH’ or ‘LOW’ level)• UVB = ultraviolet-B radiation exposure (either a ‘HIGH’ or‘LOW’ level)In addition, the studies differed with respect to various designvariables, including CO2 exposure duration (‘time’), growingmethod (‘pot’: number = pot size in liters; ‘GRND’ = plants rootedin ground; ‘HYDRO’ = solution or aeroponic culture), CO2 exposurefacility (‘method’: ‘GC’ = growth chamber; ‘GH’ = greenhouse;‘OTC’ = field-based open-top chamber), and planting stock(‘stock’: ‘SEED’ = plants started from seeds; ‘SAP’ = plantsstarted from cuttings). The goal of the meta-analysis was toexamine the effects of elevated CO2 levels on plant physiology andgrowth and the interacting effects of the environmental (anddesign) variables."],"concepts":["ecology"," ratios of means"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Hedges, L.
