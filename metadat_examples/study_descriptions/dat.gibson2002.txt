Whileself-management programs have been shown to increase patientknowledge, it is less clear to what extent they actually impacthealth outcomes. The systematic review by Gibson et al. (2002)examined the effectiveness of self-management education andregular medical review for adults with asthma. In each study,participants receiving a certain management intervention werecompared against those in a control/comparison group with respectto a variety of health outcomes. One of the outcomes examined in anumber of studies was the number of days off work/school.The majority of studies reporting this outcome provided means andstandard deviations allowing a meta-analysis of standardized meandifferences. Seven studies also reported the number ofparticipants who had one or more days off work/school in eachgroup. These studies could be meta-analyzed using, for example,(log) risk ratios. Finally, one could also consider a combinedanalysis based on standardized mean differences computed from themeans and standard deviations where available and using probittransformed risk differences (which also provide estimates of thestandardized mean difference) for the remaining studies.Some degree of patient education was provided in all studies. Inaddition, the ‘type’ variable indicates what additionalintervention components were included in each study:1. optimal self-management (writing action plan,self-monitoring, regular medical review),2. self-monitoring and regular medical review,3. self-monitoring only,4. regular medical review only,5. written action plan only."],"concepts":["medicine"," primary care"," risk ratios"," standardized mean differences"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Gibson, P.
