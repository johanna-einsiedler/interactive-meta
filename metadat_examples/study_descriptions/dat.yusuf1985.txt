(1985) onthe effectiveness of of beta blockers for reducing mortality andreinfarction.The article also describes what is sometimes called Peto'sone-step method for meta-analyzing 2x2 table data. This method isimplemented in the ‘rma.peto’ function."],"concepts":["medicine"," cardiology"," odds ratios"," Peto's method"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Yusuf, S., Peto, R., Lewis, J., Collins, R., & Sleight, P.
