Cases andnon-cases were determined based on contrast venography. Venousultrasonography was then used to make a diagnosis, leading to agiven number of true positives and negatives.A subset of this dataset (using only the studies with asymptomaticpatients) was used by Deeks et al. (2005) to illustrate methodsfor detecting publication bias (or small-study effects) inmeta-analyses of diagnostic accuracy studies."],"concepts":["medicine"," odds ratios"," diagnostic accuracy studies"," multivariatemodels"," publication bias"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Kearon, C., Julian, J. A., Math, M., Newman, T. E., & Ginsberg, J.S. (1998).
