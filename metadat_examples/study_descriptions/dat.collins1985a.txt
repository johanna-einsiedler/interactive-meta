The authors used Peto's (one-step) method formeta-analyzing the 27 trials. This approach is implemented in the‘rma.peto’ function. Using the same dataset, van Houwelingen,Zwinderman, and Stijnen (1993) describe some alternativeapproaches for analyzing these data, including fixed- andrandom-effects conditional logistic models. Those are implementedin the ‘rma.glmm’ function."],"concepts":["medicine"," odds ratios"," Peto's method"," generalized linear models"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Collins, R., & Langman, M. (1985).
