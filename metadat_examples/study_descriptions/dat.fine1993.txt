Survival was assessed at6, 12, 18, and 24 months in all but one study (which assessedsurvival only at 12 and at 24 months).The data were reconstructed by Trikalinos and Olkin (2012) basedon Table 2 in Fine et al. (1993) and Table 3 in Dear (1994). Thedata can be used to illustrate how a meta-analysis can beconducted of effect sizes reported at multiple time points using amultivariate model."],"concepts":["medicine"," oncology"," odds ratios"," longitudinal models"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Dear, K. B. G.
