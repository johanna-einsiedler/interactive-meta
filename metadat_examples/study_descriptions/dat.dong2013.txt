Mortality was low, with 2 408 deaths (4.6%) reportedacross all studies. There were nine studies that reported zeroevents in at least one of the treatment arms and three additionalstudies had zero events in all treatment arms.This data set was used in Efthimiou et al. (2019) to illustratethe Mantel-Haenszel method for network meta-analysis."],"concepts":["medicine"," odds ratios"," network meta-analysis"," Mantel-Haenszelmethod"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Dong, Y.-H., Lin, H.-H., Shau, W.-Y., Wu, Y.-C., Chang, C.-H., &Lai, M.-S. (2013).
