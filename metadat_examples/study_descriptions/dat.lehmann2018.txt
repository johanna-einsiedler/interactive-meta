Analyzing maleparticipants only, the meta-analysis should show a small,statistically significant effect (d = 0.26 [0.12, 0.40], p =.0004, N = 2,961).  Analyzing female participants only should showa very small effect (d = 0.13 [0.01, 0.25], p = .03, N = 2,739).The analyses in the published meta-analysis found clear evidenceof upward bias in the estimate for female participants andequivocal evidence for male participants.  Moderator analysessuggest effect sizes may have declined over time (both genders),may be largest when an original shade of red is used (men only),and may be smaller in pre-registered studies (women only)."],"concepts":["psychology"," attraction"," standardized mean differences"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1.
