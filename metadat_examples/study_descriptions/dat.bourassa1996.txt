Results are given in terms of 2x2 tables, indicatingthe number of left-handed left-eyed, left-handed right-eyed,right-handed left-eyed, and right-handed right-eyed individuals.Note that some studies included multiple (independent) samples, sothat the meta-analysis included 54 samples in total. Also, forsome studies, the combined data of the males and females arefurther broken down into the two subgroups.In some studies, there was indication that the selection ofsubjects was not random with respect to handedness and/oreyedness. While this should not influence the size of theassociation as measured with the odds ratio, this invalidatesthose studies for assessing the overall percentage of left-eyedand left-handed individuals.Handedness was assessed in the individual studies either based ona questionnaire or inventory or based on task performance.Eyedness was assessed based on various methods: ‘E.1’ methods arebased on task performance, while ‘E.2.a’ denotes assessment basedon a questionnaire. The performance based methods could be furtherbroken down into: ‘E.1.a.i’ (monocular procedure withobject/instrument held in one hand), ‘E.1.a.ii’ (monocularprocedure with object/instrument held in both hands), ‘E.1.b’(binocular procedure), ‘E.1.c’ (a combination of the previousmethods), and ‘E.1.d’ (some other method)."],"concepts":["psychology"," odds ratios"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Bourassa, D.
