Laopaiboon et al. (2015) conducted ameta-analysis of trials comparing the effectiveness ofazithromycin versus amoxycillin or amoxycillin/clavulanic acid(amoxyclav) in the treatment of acute lower respiratory tractinfections, including acute bacterial bronchitis, acuteexacerbations of chronic bronchitis, and pneumonia. The resultsfrom 15 trials are included in this dataset."],"concepts":["medicine"," risk ratios"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Laopaiboon, M., Panpanich, R., & Swa Mya, K. (2015).
