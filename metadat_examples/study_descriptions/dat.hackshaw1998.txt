Since the reported valueswere rounded to some extent, this introduces some minorinaccuracies into the back-calculations. The overall estimatereported in Hackshaw et al. (1997) and Hackshaw (1998) can befully reproduced though."],"concepts":["medicine"," oncology"," epidemiology"," smoking"," odds ratios"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Hackshaw, A.
