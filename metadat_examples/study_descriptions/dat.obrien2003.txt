For each study, results are given in terms of thenumber of preeclampsia cases within two or more groups defined bythe lower and upper BMI bounds as shown in the dataset (‘NA’ meansthat the interval is either open to the left or right). The ‘bmi’variable is the interval midpoint as defined by O'Brien et al.(2003)."],"concepts":["medicine"," obstetrics"," risk ratios"," proportions"," multilevel models","dose-response models"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["O'Brien, T.
