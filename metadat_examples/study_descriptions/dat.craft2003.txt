(2003) onthe relationship between the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2(CSAI-2) and sport performance.The CSAI-2 has three subscales: cognitive anxiety (‘acog’),somatic anxiety (‘asom’), and self-confidence (‘conf’). Thestudies included in this dataset administered the CSAI-2 prior tosome sport competition and then measured sport performance basedon the competition. Most studies provided all 6 correlations (3for the correlations among the 3 subscales and 3 for thecorrelations between the subscales and sport performance), but 2studies (with study numbers 6 and 17) only provided a subset."],"concepts":["psychology"," correlation coefficients"," multivariate models"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Becker, B.
