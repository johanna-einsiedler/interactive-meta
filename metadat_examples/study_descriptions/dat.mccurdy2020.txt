{"id":["dat.mccurdy2020"],"title":["Studies on the Generation Effect"],"display_title":[""],"description":["Results from 126 articles that examined the so-called ‘generationeffect’."],"details":["The generation effect is the memory benefit for self-generatedcompared with read or experimenter-provided information (Jacoby,1978; Slamecka & Graf, 1978). In a typical study, participants arepresented with a list of stimuli (usually words or word pairs).For half of the stimuli, participants self-generate a target word(e.g., open–cl____), while for the other half, participants simplyread an intact target word (e.g., above–below). On a later memorytest for the target words, the common finding is thatself-generated words are better remembered than read words (i.e.,the generation effect).Although several theories have been proposed to explain thegeneration effect, there is still some debate on the underlyingmemory mechanism(s) contributing to this phenomenon. Themeta-analysis by McCurdy et al. (2020) translated various theorieson the generation effect into hypotheses that could then be testedin moderator analyses based on a dataset containing 126 articles,310 experiments, and 1653 mean recall estimates collected undervarious conditions.Detailed explanations of the various variables coded (and howthese can be used to test various hypotheses regarding thegeneration effect) can be found in the article. The most importantvariable is ‘condition’, which denotes whether a particular row ofthe dataset corresponds to the results of a ‘read’ or a ‘generate’condition.The data structure is quite complex. Articles may have reportedthe findings from multiple experiments involving one or multiplesamples that were examined under various conditions. The ‘pairing’variable indicates which rows of the dataset represent a pairingof a read condition with one or multiple corresponding generateconditions within an experiment. A pairing may involve the samesample of subjects (when using a within-subjects design forcomparing the conditions) or different samples (when using abetween-subjects design)."],"concepts":["psychology"," memory"," proportions"," raw means"," multilevel models","cluster-robust inference"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1.
