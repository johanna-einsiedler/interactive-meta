The goal of the meta-analysis is toestimate the true (average) success rate of hyperdynamic therapy."],"concepts":["medicine"," single-arm studies"," proportions"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Zhou, X.-H., Brizendine, E. J., & Pritz, M. B. (1999).
