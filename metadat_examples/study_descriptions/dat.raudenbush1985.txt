In truth, the test was a traditional IQ test and the‘bloomers’ were a randomly selected 20% of the student population.After retesting the children 8 months later, the experimentersreported that those predicted to bloom had in fact gainedsignificantly more in total IQ (nearly 4 points) and reasoning IQ(7 points) than the control group children. Further, at the end ofthe study, the teachers rated the experimental children asintellectually more curious, happier, better adjusted, and less inneed of approval than their control group peers” (Raudenbush,1984).In the following years, a series of studies were conductedattempting to replicate this rather controversial finding.However, the great majority of those studies were unable todemonstrate a statistically significant difference between the twoexperimental groups in terms of IQ scores. Raudenbush (1984)conducted a meta-analysis based on 19 such studies to furtherexamine the evidence for the existence of the ‘Pygmalion effect’.The dataset includes the results from these studies.The outcome measure used for the meta-analysis was thestandardized mean difference (‘yi’), with positive valuesindicating that the supposed ‘bloomers’ had, on average, higher IQscores than those in the control group. The ‘weeks’ variableindicates the number of weeks of prior contact between teachersand students before the expectancy induction. Testing was doneeither in a group setting or individually, which is indicated bythe ‘setting’ variable. Finally, the ‘tester’ variable indicateswhether the test administrators were either aware or blind to theresearcher-provided designations of the children's intellectualpotential.The data in this dataset were obtained from Raudenbush and Bryk(1985) with information on the ‘setting’ and ‘tester’ variablesextracted from Raudenbush (1984)."],"concepts":["education"," standardized mean differences"," meta-regression"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Raudenbush, S.
