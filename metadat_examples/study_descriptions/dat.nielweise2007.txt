Niel-Weise et al. (2007)conducted a meta-analysis of studies comparing infection risk whenusing anti-infective-treated versus standard catheters in theacute care setting. The results from 18 such studies are includedin this dataset.The dataset was used in the article by Stijnen et al. (2010) toillustrate various generalized linear mixed-effects models for themeta-analysis of proportions and odds ratios (see ‘References’)."],"concepts":["medicine"," odds ratios"," generalized linear models"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1.
