Inaddition, the interview type and the interview structure areindicated.McDaniel et al. (1994) describe the interview type and structurevariables as follows. \"Questions in situational interviews [...]focus on the individual's ability to project what his or herbehavior would be in a given situation. [...] Job-relatedinterviews are those in which the interviewer is a personnelofficer or hiring authority and the questions attempt to assesspast behaviors and job-related information, but most questions arenot considered situational. Psychological interviews are conductedby a psychologist, and the questions are intended to assesspersonal traits, such as dependability.\" In structured interviews,\"the questions and acceptable responses were specified in advanceand the responses were rated for appropriateness of content. [...]Unstructured interviews gather applicant information in a lesssystematic manner than do structured interviews. Although thequestions may be specified in advance, they usually are not, andthere is seldom a formalized scoring guide. Also, all personsbeing interviewed are not typically asked the same questions.\"The goal of the meta-analysis was to examine the overallcriterion-related validity of employment interviews and to examinewhether the validity depends on the type and structure of theinterview.The data in this dataset were obtained from Table A.2 inRothstein, Sutton, and Borenstein (2005, p. 325-329). Note thatthe ‘type’ and ‘struct’ variables contain some ‘NA’s."],"concepts":["psychology"," correlation coefficients"," meta-regression"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Rothstein, H.
