The dataset indicates the total number of individualswithin each study arm and the number that were abstinent from 6 to12 months. The majority of the studies compared two interventionstypes against each other, while 2 studies compared three typesagainst each other simultaneously.The data can be used for a ‘network meta-analysis’ (also called a‘mixed treatment comparison’). The code below shows how such ananalysis can be conducted using an arm-based and a contrast-basedmodel (see Salanti et al., 2008, for more details)."],"concepts":["medicine"," psychology"," smoking"," odds ratios"," network meta-analysis"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Hasselblad, V.
