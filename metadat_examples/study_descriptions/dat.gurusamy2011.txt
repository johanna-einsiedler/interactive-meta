Sixstudies observed deaths in all treatment arms while three studiesdid not observe any deaths.This data set was used in Efthimiou et al. (2019) to introduce theMantel-Haenszel method for network meta-analysis.One of the treatments (solvent detergent plasma) was only includedin one study with zero events in both treatment arms; this studywas excluded from all network meta-analyses. In addition, no deathwas observed in the antithrombin III arm of the only studyevaluating this treatment which was excluded from theMantel-Haenszel network meta-analysis."],"concepts":["medicine"," odds ratios"," network meta-analysis"," Mantel-Haenszelmethod"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Gurusamy, K.
