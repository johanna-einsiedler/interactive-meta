Two trialsincluded all three treatment conditions, 7 trials comparedbeta-blockers against control, and 17 trials comparedsclerotherapy against control. The dataset has been used invarious papers to illustrate methods for conducting a networkmeta-analysis / mixed treatment comparison."],"concepts":["medicine"," odds ratios"," Mantel-Haenszel method"," networkmeta-analysis"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Pagliaro, L., D'Amico, G., Sörensen, T. I. A., Lebrec, D.,Burroughs, A.
