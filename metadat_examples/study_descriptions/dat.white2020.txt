The purpose of thismeta-analysis was to test whether structural colour signals showheightened condition-dependent expression, as predicted byevolutionary models of 'honest' signalling."],"concepts":["ecology"," evolution"," correlation coefficients"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["White, T. E.
