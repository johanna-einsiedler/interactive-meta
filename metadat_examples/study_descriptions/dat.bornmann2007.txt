A multilevelmeta-analysis model can be used to account for the multilevelstructure in these data."],"concepts":["sociology"," odds ratios"," multilevel models"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Bornmann, L., Mutz, R., & Daniel, H. (2007).
