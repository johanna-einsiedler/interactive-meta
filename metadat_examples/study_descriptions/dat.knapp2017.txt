The outcome measurefor this meta-analysis was the standardized mean difference (withpositive values indicating better performance in the healthycontrols compared to the schizophrenia patients).The dataset has a more complex structure for several reasons:1. Studies 2, 3, 9, and 20 included more than one schizophreniapatient group and the standardized mean differences werecomputed by comparing these groups against a single healthycontrol group.2. Studies 6, 12, 14, 15, 18, 19, 22, and 26 had the patientsand controls complete different tasks of varying complexity(essentially the average number of moves required to completea task). Study 6 also included two different task types.3. Study 24 provides two standardized mean differences, one formen and the other for women.4. Study 29 provides three standardized mean differences,corresponding to the three different COMT Val158Met genotypes(val/val, val/met, and met/met).All 4 issues described above lead to a multilevel structure in thedataset, with multiple standardized mean differences nested withinsome of the studies. Issues 1. and 2. also lead to correlatedsampling errors."],"concepts":["psychology"," standardized mean differences"," multilevel models","multivariate models"," cluster-robust inference"," meta-regression"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Knapp, F., Viechtbauer, W., Leonhart, R., Nitschke, K., & Kaller,C. P. (2017).
