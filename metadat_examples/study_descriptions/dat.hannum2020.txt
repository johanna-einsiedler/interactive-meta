One challenge toreaching this symptom is the wide range of reported prevalence forthis symptom ranging from 5 percent to 98 percent. In this datasetstudies were grouped into one of two groups based on the type ofmethod used to measure smell loss (either subjective measures,such as self-reported smell loss, or objective measures usingrated stimuli)."],"concepts":["medicine"," covid-19"," proportions"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Ramirez VA , Hannum ME, Lipson SJ, Herriman RD, Toskala AK, Lin C,Joseph PV, Reed DR. 2020.
