Secondary outcomes (also measured as dichotomous) wereearly remission (defined as having a symptom score below a fixedthreshold after completion of treatment), lost to follow-up, lostto follow-up due to adverse events, and any adverse event. Theodds ratio was used as effect measure.This data set was used as an example in Rücker and Schwarzer(2017) who introduced methods to resolve conflicting rankings ofoutcomes in network meta-analysis."],"concepts":["medicine"," psychiatry"," odds ratios"," network meta-analysis"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group).
