In the controlled (two-arm) studies (studies 1-4), a cohort of patients in complete remission and potentially eligible for BMT was assembled, and those who consented and for whom a donor could be found received BMT, with the remaining patients used as controls (receiving CMO). In the uncontrolled (one-arm) studies (studies 5-16), only a single group was studied, receiving either BMT or CMO.  The data in this dataset were obtained from Table 1 in Begg and Pilote (1991, p. 902)."], "concepts": ["medicine", " oncology", " single-arm studies", " multilevel models"], "note": [""], "source": ["Begg, C.
