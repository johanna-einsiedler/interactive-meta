Data were extracted from Table 1 and Figure 3 from Linde et al. (2005). For study duration, the assessment week (instead of the total study duration) was coded for Philipp et al. (1999) and Montgomery et al. (2000). For dosage, the midpoint was coded when a range of values was given.  The definition of what constitutes a \u2018response\u2019 differed across studies and is coded as follows:  1. HRSD score reduction of at least 50% or HRSD score after therapy <10,  2. HRSD reduction of at least 50%,  3. based on HRSD scale but exact definition not reported,  4. global patient assessment of efficacy,  5. at least \u2018much improved\u2019 on the Clinical Global Impression sub-scale for global improvement.  The \u2018group\u2019 variable corresponds to the variable used by Linde et al. (2005) to stratify their analyses and is coded as follows:  1. smaller trials restricted to major depression,  2. larger trials restricted to major depression,  3. smaller trials not restricted to major depression,  4. larger trials not restricted to major depression."], "concepts": ["medicine", " psychiatry", " risk ratios"], "note": [""], "source": ["Linde, K., Berner, M., Egger, M., & Mulrow, C.
