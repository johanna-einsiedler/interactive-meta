{"id":["dat.bakdash2021"],"title":["Dataset on Situation Awareness and Task Performance Associations"],"display_title":[""],"description":["Results from 77 papers with 678 effects evaluating associations among measures of situation awareness and task performance."],"details":["The dataset contains behavioral experiments from 77 papers/79 studies with a total of 678 effects, evaluating associations among measures of situation awareness (“knowing what is going on”) and task performance. Examples of situation awareness include knowledge of current vehicle speed in a simulated driving task and location and heading of aircraft in a simulated air traffic control task. Corresponding examples of task performance include “the number of collisions in a simulated driving task” and “subject matter expert rating of conflict management in a simulated air control task” (Bakdash et al. 2021a, p. 2). This dataset and the ‘Examples’ are a highly simplified version of the data and code in Bakdash et al. (2021b; 2021c). The journal article by Bakdash et al. (2021a) describes the systematic review and meta-analysis in detail.  This dataset is used to illustrate multilevel multivariate meta-analytic models for the overall pooled effect and pooled effects by situation awareness measure. We also adjust meta-analytic models using cluster-robust variance estimation / cluster-robust inference with the ‘robust’ function in _metafor_. Results are shown graphically in a customized forest plot with a prediction interval (estimated plausible range of individual effects). Last, we create a table summarizing the estimated meta-analytic heterogeneity parameters.  The meta-analytic results show most pooled effect sizes in the positive medium range or less. There was also substantial meta-analytic heterogeneity (estimated systematic variance in true effects), nearing the magnitude of the overall pooled effect. We interpret the meta-analytic results as situation awareness typically having limited validity for task performance (i.e., good situation awareness does not tend to have strong probabilistic links with good performance and vice-versa). More formally, measures of situation awareness do not generally and meaningfully capture cognitive processes and other relevant factors underlying task performance.  Run-Time:  The code run-time can be greatly sped-up using a linear algebra library with _R_ that makes use of multiple CPU cores. See: <URL: https://www.metafor-project.org/doku.php/tips:speeding_up_model_fitting>. To measure the run-time, uncomment these three lines: ‘start.time <- Sys.time()’, ‘end.time <- Sys.time()’, and ‘end.time - start.time’. Run-times on Windows 10 x64 with the Intel Math Kernel Library are:  _CPU_      _Run-Time (Minutes)_ i7-11850H  2.49 i7-4770    5.38 "],"concepts":["psychology"," human factors"," engineering"," correlation coefficients"," multilevel models"," multivariate models"," cluster-robust inference"],"note":[""],"source":["Bakdash, J.
