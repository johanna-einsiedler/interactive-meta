Values of the log odds ratio greater than 0 indicate an increased risk of cancer in exposed women compared to women not exposed to ETS from their spouse.  Note that the log odds ratios and corresponding sampling variances were back-calculated from the reported odds ratios and confidence interval (CI) bounds (see \u2018Examples\u2019). Since the reported values were rounded to some extent, this introduces some minor inaccuracies into the back-calculations. The overall estimate reported in Hackshaw et al. (1997) and Hackshaw (1998) can be fully reproduced though."], "concepts": ["medicine", " oncology", " epidemiology", " smoking", " odds ratios"], "note": [""], "source": ["Hackshaw, A. K., Law, M.
