The dataset is interesting because it can be used to illustrate the difference between naively pooling results by summing up the counts across studies and then computing the odds ratio based on the aggregated table (as was done by Van Howe, 1999) and conducting a proper meta-analysis (as illustrated by O'Farrell & Egger, 2000). In fact, a proper meta-analysis shows that the HIV infection risk is on average higher in non-circumcised men, which is the opposite of what the naive pooling approach yields (which makes this an illustration of Simpson's paradox)."], "concepts": ["medicine", " epidemiology", " odds ratios"], "note": [""], "source": ["Van Howe, R.
