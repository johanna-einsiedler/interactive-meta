Anti-infective-treated catheters have been developed that are meant to reduce the risk of CRBSIs. Niel-Weise et al. (2008) conducted a meta-analysis of studies comparing infection risk when using anti-infective-treated versus standard catheters for total parenteral nutrition or chemotherapy. The results from 9 such studies are included in this dataset.  The dataset was used in the article by Stijnen et al. (2010) to illustrate various generalized linear mixed-effects models for the meta-analysis of incidence rates and incidence rate ratios (see \u2018References\u2019)."], "concepts": ["medicine", " incidence rates", " generalized linear models"], "note": [""], "source": ["Niel-Weise, B.
