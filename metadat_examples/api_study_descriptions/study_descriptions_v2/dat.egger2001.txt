Studies 1-7 were included in the meta-analyses by Teo et al. (1991) and Horner (1992) and were combined with the results from the LIMIT-2 trial (Woods et al., 1992) in Yusuf et al. (1993), suggesting that magnesium is an effective treatment for reducing mortality. However, the results from the ISIS-4 mega trial (ISIS-4 Collaborative Group, 1995) indicated no reduction in mortality with magnesium treatment. Publication bias has been suggested as one possible explanation for the conflicting findings (Egger & Davey Smith, 1995).  The present dataset includes some additional trials and are based on Table 18.2 from Egger, Davey Smith, and Altman (2001)."], "concepts": ["medicine", " cardiology", " Peto's method", " publication bias"], "note": [""], "source": ["Egger, M., Davey Smith, G., & Altman, D.
