Cases and non-cases were determined based on contrast venography. Venous ultrasonography was then used to make a diagnosis, leading to a given number of true positives and negatives.  A subset of this dataset (using only the studies with asymptomatic patients) was used by Deeks et al. (2005) to illustrate methods for detecting publication bias (or small-study effects) in meta-analyses of diagnostic accuracy studies."], "concepts": ["medicine", " odds ratios", " diagnostic accuracy studies", " multivariate models", " publication bias"], "note": [""], "source": ["Kearon, C., Julian, J.
