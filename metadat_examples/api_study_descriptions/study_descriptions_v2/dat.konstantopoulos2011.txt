The effects of using such a modified calendar on student achievement have been examined in a number of studies and were meta-analyzed by Cooper et al. (2003).  The dataset (taken from Konstantopoulos, 2011) contains the results from 56 studies, each comparing the level of academic achievement in a group of students following a modified school calendar with that of a group of students following a more traditional school calendar. The difference between the two groups was quantified in terms of a standardized mean difference (with positive values indicating a higher mean level of achievement in the group following the modified school calendar).  The studies were conducted at various schools that were clustered within districts. The data therefore have a multilevel structure, with schools nested within districts. A multilevel meta-analysis of these data can be used to estimate and account for the amount of heterogeneity between districts and between schools within districts."], "concepts": ["education", " standardized mean differences", " multilevel models"], "note": [""], "source": ["Konstantopoulos, S.
