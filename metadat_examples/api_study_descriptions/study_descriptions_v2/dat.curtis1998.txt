The \u2018co2.ambi\u2019 and \u2018co2.elev\u2019 variables indicate the CO2 levels in the control and treatment groups, respectively (with the \u2018units\u2019 variable specifying the units for the CO2 exposure levels). Many of the studies also varied one or more additional environmental variables (defined by the \u2018xtrt\u2019 and \u2018level\u2019 variables):  \u2022 NONE = no additional treatment factor  \u2022 FERT = soil fertility (either a \u2018CONTROL\u2019, \u2018HIGH\u2019, or \u2018LOW\u2019 level)  \u2022 LIGHT = light treatment (always a \u2018LOW\u2019 light level)  \u2022 FERT+L = soil fertility and light (a \u2018LOW\u2019 light and soil fertility level)  \u2022 H2O = well watered vs drought (either a \u2018WW\u2019 or \u2018DRT\u2019 level)  \u2022 TEMP = temperature treatment (either a \u2018HIGH\u2019 or \u2018LOW\u2019 level)  \u2022 OZONE = ozone exposure (either a \u2018HIGH\u2019 or \u2018LOW\u2019 level)  \u2022 UVB = ultraviolet-B radiation exposure (either a \u2018HIGH\u2019 or \u2018LOW\u2019 level)  In addition, the studies differed with respect to various design variables, including CO2 exposure duration (\u2018time\u2019), growing method (\u2018pot\u2019: number = pot size in liters; \u2018GRND\u2019 = plants rooted in ground; \u2018HYDRO\u2019 = solution or aeroponic culture), CO2 exposure facility (\u2018method\u2019: \u2018GC\u2019 = growth chamber; \u2018GH\u2019 = greenhouse; \u2018OTC\u2019 = field-based open-top chamber), and planting stock (\u2018stock\u2019: \u2018SEED\u2019 = plants started from seeds; \u2018SAP\u2019 = plants started from cuttings). The goal of the meta-analysis was to examine the effects of elevated CO2 levels on plant physiology and growth and the interacting effects of the environmental (and design) variables."], "concepts": ["ecology", " ratios of means"], "note": [""], "source": ["Hedges, L.
