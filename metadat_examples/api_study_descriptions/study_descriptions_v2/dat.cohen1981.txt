Instead of correlating individual ratings and achievement scores, the studies were carried out in multisection courses, in which the sections had different instructors but all sections used a common achievement measure (e.g., a final exam). The correlation coefficients reflect the correlation between the mean instructor rating and the mean achievement score of each section. Hence, the unit of analysis are the sections, not the individuals.  Note that this dataset (extracted from Table A.3 in Cooper & Hedges, 1994) only contains studies with at least 10 sections."], "concepts": ["education", " correlation coefficients"], "note": [""], "source": ["Cooper, H., & Hedges, L.
