One challenge to reaching this symptom is the wide range of reported prevalence for this symptom ranging from 5 percent to 98 percent. In this dataset studies were grouped into one of two groups based on the type of method used to measure smell loss (either subjective measures, such as self-reported smell loss, or objective measures using rated stimuli)."], "concepts": ["medicine", " covid-19", " proportions"], "note": [""], "source": ["Ramirez VA , Hannum ME, Lipson SJ, Herriman RD, Toskala AK, Lin C, Joseph PV, Reed DR. 2020.
