Effectiveness was measured after one and two days of treatment in terms of 4 different outcome variables:  1. \u2018rnic1\u2019 and \u2018rnic2\u2019 (continuous): incremental change (improvement) in runny nose severity at day 1 and day 2,  2. \u2018rngoal1\u2019 and \u2018rngoal2\u2019 (dichotomous): reaching the goal of therapy (of at least a 50% reduction in runny nose severity) at day 1 and day 2,  3. \u2018snic1\u2019 and \u2018snic2\u2019 (continuous): incremental change (improvement) in sneezing severity at day 1 and day 2, and  4. \u2018rngoal1\u2019 and \u2018rngoal2\u2019 (dichotomous): reaching the goal of therapy (of at least a 50% reduction in sneezing severity) at day 1 and day 2.  For the continuous outcomes, standardized mean differences can be computed to quantify the difference between the treatment and control groups. For the dichotomous outcomes, one can compute (log) odds ratios to quantify the difference between the treatment and control groups."], "concepts": ["medicine", " standardized mean differences", " odds ratios", " multivariate models"], "note": [""], "source": ["D'Agostino, R.
