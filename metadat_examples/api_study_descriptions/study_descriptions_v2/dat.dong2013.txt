Mortality was reported in 41 randomized trials, with a total of 52 462 patients. Mortality was low, with 2 408 deaths (4.6%) reported across all studies. There were nine studies that reported zero events in at least one of the treatment arms and three additional studies had zero events in all treatment arms.  This data set was used in Efthimiou et al.
