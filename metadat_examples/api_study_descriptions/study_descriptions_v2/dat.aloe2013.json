(2009).The dataset can be used to illustrate the meta-analysis ofregression models, using measures such as the (semi-)partialcorrelation coefficient. For this, the t-statistic from theregression model for the association (i.e., predictor) of interestwas extracted from each regression model (‘tval’), as well as thesample size (‘n’), the number of predictors included in theregression model (‘preds’), and the coefficient of determination(i.e., R-squared value) of the regression model (‘R2’). Based onthis information, the (semi-)partial correlation coefficient canbe computed for each study, as well as its corresponding samplingvariance. These values can then be meta-analyzed using standardmethods."],"concepts":["social work"," (semi-)partial correlations"," meta-regression"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Aloe, A.
