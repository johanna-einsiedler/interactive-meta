  "description": [
    "Results from 17 studies on the association between recidivism and mental health in delinquent juveniles."
  ],
  "details": [
    "The studies included in this dataset (which is a subset of thedata used in Assink et al., 2015) compared the difference in recidivism between delinquent juveniles with a mental health disorder and a comparison group of juveniles without a mental health disorder. Since studies differed in the way recidivism was defined and assessed, results are given in terms of standardized mean differences, with positive values indicating a higher prevalence of recidivism in the group of juveniles with a mental health disorder. Multiple effect size estimates could be extracted from moststudies (e.g., for different delinquent behaviors in whichjuveniles could have recidivated), necessitating the use of appropriate models/methods for the analysis. Assink and Wibbelink(2016) illustrate the use of multilevel meta-analysis models for this purpose."
