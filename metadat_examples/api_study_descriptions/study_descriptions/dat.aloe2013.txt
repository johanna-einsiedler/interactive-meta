The dataset was extracted from Aloe and Thompson (2013), which in turn is a subset of the studies included in the meta-analysis by Mor Barak et al. (2009).  The dataset can be used to illustrate the meta-analysis of regression models, using measures such as the (semi-)partial correlation coefficient. For this, the t-statistic from the regression model for the association (i.e., predictor) of interest was extracted from each regression model (‘tval’), as well as the sample size (‘n’), the number of predictors included in the regression model (‘preds’), and the coefficient of determination (i.e., R-squared value) of the regression model (‘R2’). Based on this information, the (semi-)partial correlation coefficient can be computed for each study, as well as its corresponding sampling variance. These values can then be meta-analyzed using standard methods."],"concepts":["social work"," (semi-)partial correlations"," meta-regression"],"note":[""],"source":["Aloe, A. M., & Thompson, C. G.
