The dataset includesthe results from 46 studies examining the effects of DBS of thesubthalamic nucleus on motor functioning, measured with theUnified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). The effect sizemeasure for this meta-analysis was the mean difference of thescores while the stimulator is active and the baseline scores(before implantation of the stimulator). Since lower scores on theUPDRS indicate better functioning, negative numbers indicateimprovements in motor skills. Effects were generally measured at3, 6, and 12 months after implantation of the stimulator, withsome studies also including a further long-term follow-up.However, the number of measurements differed between studies -hence the missing data on some of the measurement occasions.Since the same patients were followed over time within a study,effect size estimates from multiple measurement occasions arelikely to be correlated. A multivariate model accounting for thecorrelation in the effects can be used to meta-analyze these data.A difficulty with this approach is the lack of information aboutthe correlation of the measurements over time in the individualstudies. The approach taken by Ishak et al. (2007) was to assumean autoregressive (AR1) structure for the estimates within theindividual studies. In addition, the correlation in the trueeffects was modeled, again using an autoregressive structure."],"concepts":["medicine"," raw mean differences"," longitudinal models"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1.
