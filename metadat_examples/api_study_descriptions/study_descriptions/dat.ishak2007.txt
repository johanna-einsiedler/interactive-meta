The dataset includes the results from 46 studies examining the effects of DBS of the subthalamic nucleus on motor functioning, measured with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). The effect size measure for this meta-analysis was the mean difference of the scores while the stimulator is active and the baseline scores (before implantation of the stimulator). Since lower scores on the UPDRS indicate better functioning, negative numbers indicate improvements in motor skills. Effects were generally measured at 3, 6, and 12 months after implantation of the stimulator, with some studies also including a further long-term follow-up. However, the number of measurements differed between studies - hence the missing data on some of the measurement occasions.  Since the same patients were followed over time within a study, effect size estimates from multiple measurement occasions are likely to be correlated. A multivariate model accounting for the correlation in the effects can be used to meta-analyze these data. A difficulty with this approach is the lack of information about the correlation of the measurements over time in the individual studies. The approach taken by Ishak et al. (2007) was to assume an autoregressive (AR1) structure for the estimates within the individual studies. In addition, the correlation in the true effects was modeled, again using an autoregressive structure."],"concepts":["medicine"," raw mean differences"," longitudinal models"],"note":[""],"source":["Ishak, K.
