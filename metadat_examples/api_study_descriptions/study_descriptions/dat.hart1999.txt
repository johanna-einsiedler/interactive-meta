Inaddition, the number of patients and the total person-time (inyears) is provided for the two groups. The goal of themeta-analysis was to examine the effectiveness of adjusted-dosewarfarin for preventing strokes in patients with atrialfibrillation."],"concepts":["medicine"," cardiology"," incidence rates"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Hart, R.
