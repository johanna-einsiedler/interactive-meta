Effectiveness was measuredafter one and two days of treatment in terms of 4 differentoutcome variables:1. ‘rnic1’ and ‘rnic2’ (continuous): incremental change(improvement) in runny nose severity at day 1 and day 2,2. ‘rngoal1’ and ‘rngoal2’ (dichotomous): reaching the goal oftherapy (of at least a 50% reduction in runny nose severity)at day 1 and day 2,3. ‘snic1’ and ‘snic2’ (continuous): incremental change(improvement) in sneezing severity at day 1 and day 2, and4. ‘rngoal1’ and ‘rngoal2’ (dichotomous): reaching the goal oftherapy (of at least a 50% reduction in sneezing severity) atday 1 and day 2.For the continuous outcomes, standardized mean differences can becomputed to quantify the difference between the treatment andcontrol groups. For the dichotomous outcomes, one can compute(log) odds ratios to quantify the difference between the treatmentand control groups."],"concepts":["medicine"," standardized mean differences"," odds ratios"," multivariatemodels"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["D'Agostino, R.
