The dataset indicates the total number of individuals within each study arm and the number that were abstinent from 6 to 12 months. The majority of the studies compared two interventions types against each other, while 2 studies compared three types against each other simultaneously.  The data can be used for a ‘network meta-analysis’ (also called a ‘mixed treatment comparison’). The code below shows how such an analysis can be conducted using an arm-based and a contrast-based model (see Salanti et al., 2008, for more details)."],"concepts":["medicine"," psychology"," smoking"," odds ratios"," network meta-analysis"],"note":[""],"source":["Hasselblad, V.
