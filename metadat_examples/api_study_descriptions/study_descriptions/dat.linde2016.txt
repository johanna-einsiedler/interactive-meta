The primary outcome was response after treatment (yes/no),defined as a reduction from baseline by at least 50% on adepression scale. The data set contains log odds ratios withstandard errors for all pairwise comparisons.The interventions comprised both medical and psychologicaltreatments, also in combination, including placebo and usual care(UC) (Linde et al., 2016). Pharmacological interventions weretricyclic antidepressants (TCA), selective serotonin reuptakeinhibitors (SSRI), serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors(SNRI), noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (NRI), low- doseserotonin (5-HT2) antagonists and reuptake inhibitors (low-doseSARI), noradrenergic and specific serotonergic agents (NaSSa),reversible inhibitors of monoaminoxidase A (rMAO-A), hypericumextracts, and an individualized drug. Psychological interventionswere cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; four forms: face-to-faceCBT, remote therapist-led CBT, guided self-help CBT, and no orminimal contact CBT), face-to-face problem-solving therapy (PST),face-to-face interpersonal psychotherapy, face-to-facepsychodynamic therapy, and “other face-to-face therapy”.Combination therapies were face-to-face CBT + SSRI, face-to-facePST + SSRI, and face-to-face interpersonal psychotherapy + SSRI.The data set was used as an example in Rücker et al. (2020) toillustrate component network meta-analysis using frequentistmethods."],"concepts":["medicine"," psychiatry"," odds ratios"," network meta-analysis","component network meta-analysis"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1.

This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Linde, K., Rücker, G., Schneider, A., & Kriston, L.
