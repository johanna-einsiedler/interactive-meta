{"id":["dat.maire2019"],"title":["Studies on Temporal Trends in Fish Community Structures in French Rivers"],"display_title":[""],"description":["Results from studies examining changes in the abundance of fish species in French rivers."],"details":["The dataset includes the results from 35 sampling stations (at 11 sites along various French rivers) examining the abundance of various fish species over time (i.e., over 19-37 years, all until 2015). The temporal trend in these abundance data was quantified in terms of Mann-Kendal trend statistics, with positive values indicating monotonically increasing trends. The corresponding sampling variances were corrected for the temporal autocorrelation in the data (Hamed & Rao, 1998).  The distance matrix ‘dmat’ indicates the distance of the sampling stations (1-423 river-km). For stations not connected through the river network, a high distance value of 10,000 river-km was set (effectively forcing the spatial correlation to be 0 for such stations).  The dataset can be used to illustrate a meta-analysis allowing for spatial correlation in the outcomes."],"concepts":["ecology"," climate change"," spatial correlation"],"note":[""],"source":["Maire, A., Thierry, E., Viechtbauer, W., & Daufresne, M.
