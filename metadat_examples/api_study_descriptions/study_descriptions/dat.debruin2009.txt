However, achieving viral suppression (tothe point that the virus becomes essentially undetectable in ablood sample) requires high levels of adherence to an oftencomplicated medication regimen. A number of trials have examinedvarious interventions that aim to increase adherence levels. Ineach trial, patients receiving the intervention are compared topatients in a control group receiving standard care (oftenreferred to as ‘care as usual’). However, the quality of standardcare can vary substantially between these studies. de Bruin et al.(2009) assessed the quality of standard care provided (based on aquantification of the number of behavior change techniquesapplied) and examined to what extent the quality of standard carewas related to the proportion of patients achieving effectiveviral suppression in the control groups."],"concepts":["psychology"," medicine"," proportions"," single-arm studies","meta-regression"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["de Bruin, M., Viechtbauer, W., Hospers, H. J., Schaalma, H. P., &Kok, G. (2009).
