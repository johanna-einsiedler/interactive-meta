Some studies included multiple samples andhence the dataset actually contains 97 correlation coefficients.The dataset was obtained via personal communication. Note thatthis dataset differs just slightly from the one used by Credé etal. (2010)."],"concepts":["education"," correlation coefficients"," multilevel models"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Personal communication."],"references":["Credé, M., Roch, S. G., & Kieszczynka, U. M. (2010).
