The outcome measured in the studies was either the mean HbA1c level at follow-up or the mean change in HbA1c level from baseline to follow-up. A total of 10 different treatment types were examined in these studies: acarbose, benfluorex, metformin, miglitol, pioglitazone, placebo, rosiglitazone, sitagliptin, sulfonylurea alone, and vildagliptin. One study included three treatment arms (Willms, 1999), while the rest of the studies included two treatment arms (hence, the dataset includes the results from 53 treatment arms).  The data can be used for a network meta-analysis, either using an arm-based or a contrast-based model.
