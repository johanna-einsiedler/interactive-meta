The outcome measured in the studieswas either the mean HbA1c level at follow-up or the mean change inHbA1c level from baseline to follow-up. A total of 10 differenttreatment types were examined in these studies: acarbose,benfluorex, metformin, miglitol, pioglitazone, placebo,rosiglitazone, sitagliptin, sulfonylurea alone, and vildagliptin.One study included three treatment arms (Willms, 1999), while therest of the studies included two treatment arms (hence, thedataset includes the results from 53 treatment arms).The data can be used for a network meta-analysis, either using anarm-based or a contrast-based model. See ‘Examples’ below."],"concepts":["medicine"," raw mean differences"," network meta-analysis"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Senn, S., Gavini, F., Magrez, D., & Scheen, A. (2013).
