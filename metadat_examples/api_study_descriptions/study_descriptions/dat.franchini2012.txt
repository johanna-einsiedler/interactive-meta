The outcome is mean lostwork-time reduction in patients given dopamine agonists as adjuncttherapy. The data are given as sample size, mean, and standarddeviation in each trial arm.This data set was used as an example in the supplemental materialof Dias et al. (2013) where placebo is coded as 1 and the fouractive drugs as 2 to 5."],"concepts":["medicine"," raw mean differences"," network meta-analysis"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Dias, S., Sutton, A. J., Ades, A. E., & Welton, N. J.
