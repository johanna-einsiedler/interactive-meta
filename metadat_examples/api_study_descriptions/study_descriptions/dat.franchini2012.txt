The outcome is mean lost work-time reduction in patients given dopamine agonists as adjunct therapy. The data are given as sample size, mean, and standard deviation in each trial arm.  This data set was used as an example in the supplemental material of Dias et al. (2013) where placebo is coded as 1 and the four active drugs as 2 to 5."],"concepts":["medicine"," raw mean differences"," network meta-analysis"],"note":[""],"source":["Dias, S., Sutton, A.
