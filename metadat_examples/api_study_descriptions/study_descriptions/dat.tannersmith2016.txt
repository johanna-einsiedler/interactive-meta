Multiple coefficients could be extracted from the studies “given the numerous ways in which school motivation/attitudes variables could be operationalized (e.g., academic aspirations, academic self-efficacy) as well as the numerous ways in which crime/delinquency could be operationalized (e.g., property crime, violent crime)” (Tanner-Smith et al., 2016).  Since information to compute the covariance between multiple coefficients within studies is not available, Tanner-Smith et al. (2016) illustrate the use of cluster-robust inference methods for the analysis of this dataset.  Note that this dataset is only meant to be used for pedagogical and demonstration purposes and does not constitute a proper review or synthesis of the complete and current research evidence on the given topic."],"concepts":["psychology"," criminology"," correlation coefficients"," multilevel models"," cluster-robust inference"," meta-regression"],"note":[""],"source":["Tanner-Smith, E.
