Niel-Weise et al. (2008)conducted a meta-analysis of studies comparing infection risk whenusing anti-infective-treated versus standard catheters for totalparenteral nutrition or chemotherapy. The results from 9 suchstudies are included in this dataset.The dataset was used in the article by Stijnen et al. (2010) toillustrate various generalized linear mixed-effects models for themeta-analysis of incidence rates and incidence rate ratios (see‘References’)."],"concepts":["medicine"," incidence rates"," generalized linear models"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1.
