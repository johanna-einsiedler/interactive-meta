Breast cancer casesand controls were genotyped and either had a homozygous insertion,a heterozygous insertion/deletion, or a homozygous deletionpolymorphism.Ziegler et al. (2011) used the same dataset to illustrate the useof meta-analytic methods to examine deviations from Hardy-Weinbergequilibrium across multiple studies. The relative excessheterozygosity (REH) is the proposed measure for such ameta-analysis, which can be computed by setting ‘measure=\"REH\"’."],"concepts":["medicine"," oncology"," genetics"," odds ratios"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Frank, B., Rigas, S. H., Bermejo, J. L., Wiestler, M., Wagner, K.,Hemminki, K., Reed, M.
