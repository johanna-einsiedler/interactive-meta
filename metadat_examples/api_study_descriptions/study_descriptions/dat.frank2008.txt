Breast cancer cases and controls were genotyped and either had a homozygous insertion, a heterozygous insertion/deletion, or a homozygous deletion polymorphism.  Ziegler et al. (2011) used the same dataset to illustrate the use of meta-analytic methods to examine deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium across multiple studies. The relative excess heterozygosity (REH) is the proposed measure for such a meta-analysis, which can be computed by setting ‘measure=\"REH\"’."],"concepts":["medicine"," oncology"," genetics"," odds ratios"],"note":[""],"source":["Frank, B., Rigas, S.
