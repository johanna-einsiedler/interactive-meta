(2003) on the relationship between the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2 (CSAI-2) and sport performance.  The CSAI-2 has three subscales: cognitive anxiety (‘acog’), somatic anxiety (‘asom’), and self-confidence (‘conf’). The studies included in this dataset administered the CSAI-2 prior to some sport competition and then measured sport performance based on the competition. Most studies provided all 6 correlations (3 for the correlations among the 3 subscales and 3 for the correlations between the subscales and sport performance), but 2 studies (with study numbers 6 and 17) only provided a subset."],"concepts":["psychology"," correlation coefficients"," multivariate models"],"note":[""],"source":["Becker, B.
