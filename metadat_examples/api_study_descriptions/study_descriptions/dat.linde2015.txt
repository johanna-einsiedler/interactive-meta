The primary outcome is early response, defined as at least a 50% score reduction on a depression scale after completion of treatment. Secondary outcomes (also measured as dichotomous) were early remission (defined as having a symptom score below a fixed threshold after completion of treatment), lost to follow-up, lost to follow-up due to adverse events, and any adverse event. The odds ratio was used as effect measure.  This data set was used as an example in Rücker and Schwarzer (2017) who introduced methods to resolve conflicting rankings of outcomes in network meta-analysis."],"concepts":["medicine"," psychiatry"," odds ratios"," network meta-analysis"],"note":[""],"source":["Linde, K., Kriston, L., Rücker, G., Jamil, S., Schumann, I., Meissner, K., Sigterman, K., & Schneider, A.
