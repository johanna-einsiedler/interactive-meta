For study duration, the assessment week (instead of thetotal study duration) was coded for Philipp et al. (1999) andMontgomery et al. (2000). For dosage, the midpoint was coded whena range of values was given.The definition of what constitutes a ‘response’ differed acrossstudies and is coded as follows:1. HRSD score reduction of at least 50% or HRSD score aftertherapy <10,2. HRSD reduction of at least 50%,3. based on HRSD scale but exact definition not reported,4. global patient assessment of efficacy,5. at least ‘much improved’ on the Clinical Global Impressionsub-scale for global improvement.The ‘group’ variable corresponds to the variable used by Linde etal. (2005) to stratify their analyses and is coded as follows:1. smaller trials restricted to major depression,2. larger trials restricted to major depression,3. smaller trials not restricted to major depression,4. larger trials not restricted to major depression."],"concepts":["medicine"," psychiatry"," risk ratios"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Linde, K., Berner, M., Egger, M., & Mulrow, C. (2005).
