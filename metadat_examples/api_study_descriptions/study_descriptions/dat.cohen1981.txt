Instead of correlating individualratings and achievement scores, the studies were carried out inmultisection courses, in which the sections had differentinstructors but all sections used a common achievement measure(e.g., a final exam). The correlation coefficients reflect thecorrelation between the mean instructor rating and the meanachievement score of each section. Hence, the unit of analysis arethe sections, not the individuals.Note that this dataset (extracted from Table A.3 in Cooper &Hedges, 1994) only contains studies with at least 10 sections."],"concepts":["education"," correlation coefficients"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Cooper, H., & Hedges, L. V. (1994). Appendix A: Data Sets. In H.Cooper & L. V.
