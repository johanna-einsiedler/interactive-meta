The scale has been usedin several studies to examine depressive symptoms in childrenproviding care to an elderly parent. The dataset includesinformation on the reliability of the scale as measured withCronbach's alpha in 9 such studies. Also, the gender compositionof the children in each sample is indicated."],"concepts":["psychology"," Cronbach's alpha"," reliability generalization","meta-regression"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Bonett, D. G.
