The scale has been used in several studies to examine depressive symptoms in children providing care to an elderly parent. The dataset includes information on the reliability of the scale as measured with Cronbach's alpha in 9 such studies. Also, the gender composition of the children in each sample is indicated."],"concepts":["psychology"," Cronbach's alpha"," reliability generalization"," meta-regression"],"note":[""],"source":["Bonett, D.
