(1989) conducted a meta-analysis of death rates inrandomized controlled trials in which prophylactic lidocaine wasadministered to patients with confirmed or suspected acutemyocardial infarction. The dataset describes the mortality at theend of the assigned treatment period for control and intravenouslidocaine treatment groups for six studies. The question ofinterest is whether there is a detrimental effect of lidocaine.Because the studies were conducted to compare rates of arrhythmiasfollowing a heart attack, the studies, taken individually, are toosmall to detect important differences in mortality rates.The data in this dataset were obtained from Table I in Normand(1999, p. 322)."],"concepts":["medicine"," cardiology"," risk differences"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1.
