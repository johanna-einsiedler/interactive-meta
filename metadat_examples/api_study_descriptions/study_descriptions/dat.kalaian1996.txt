This dataset contains standardized mean differences comparing the performance of a coached versus uncoached group on the verbal and/or math subtest of the SAT. Studies may report a standardized mean difference for the verbal subtest, the math subtest, or both. In the latter case, the two standardized mean differences are not independent (since they were measured in the same group of subjects). The number of hours of coaching (variable ‘hrs’), whether the study was conducted by the Educational Testing Service (variable ‘ets’), whether homework was assigned outside of the coaching course (variable ‘homework’), and the study type (variable ‘type’) may be potential moderators of the treatment effect."],"concepts":["education"," standardized mean differences"," multivariate models"," meta-regression"],"note":["The dataset was obtained from Table 1 in Kalaian and Raudenbush (1996).
