This dataset containsstandardized mean differences comparing the performance of acoached versus uncoached group on the verbal and/or math subtestof the SAT. Studies may report a standardized mean difference forthe verbal subtest, the math subtest, or both. In the latter case,the two standardized mean differences are not independent (sincethey were measured in the same group of subjects). The number ofhours of coaching (variable ‘hrs’), whether the study wasconducted by the Educational Testing Service (variable ‘ets’),whether homework was assigned outside of the coaching course(variable ‘homework’), and the study type (variable ‘type’) may bepotential moderators of the treatment effect."],"concepts":["education"," standardized mean differences"," multivariate models","meta-regression"],"note":["The dataset was obtained from Table 1 in Kalaian and Raudenbush(1996). However, there appear to be some inconsistencies betweenthe data in the table and those that were actually used for theanalyses (see ‘Examples’)."],"source":["Kalaian, H. A., & Raudenbush, S. W.
