In fact, a proper meta-analysis shows that the HIVinfection risk is on average higher in non-circumcised men, whichis the opposite of what the naive pooling approach yields (whichmakes this an illustration of Simpson's paradox)."],"concepts":["medicine"," epidemiology"," odds ratios"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1.
