{"id":["dat.mccurdy2020"],"title":["Studies on the Generation Effect"],"display_title":[""],"description":["Results from 126 articles that examined the so-called ‘generation effect’."],"details":["The generation effect is the memory benefit for self-generated compared with read or experimenter-provided information (Jacoby, 1978; Slamecka & Graf, 1978). In a typical study, participants are presented with a list of stimuli (usually words or word pairs). For half of the stimuli, participants self-generate a target word (e.g., open–cl____), while for the other half, participants simply read an intact target word (e.g., above–below). On a later memory test for the target words, the common finding is that self-generated words are better remembered than read words (i.e., the generation effect).  Although several theories have been proposed to explain the generation effect, there is still some debate on the underlying memory mechanism(s) contributing to this phenomenon. The meta-analysis by McCurdy et al. (2020) translated various theories on the generation effect into hypotheses that could then be tested in moderator analyses based on a dataset containing 126 articles, 310 experiments, and 1653 mean recall estimates collected under various conditions.  Detailed explanations of the various variables coded (and how these can be used to test various hypotheses regarding the generation effect) can be found in the article. The most important variable is ‘condition’, which denotes whether a particular row of the dataset corresponds to the results of a ‘read’ or a ‘generate’ condition.  The data structure is quite complex. Articles may have reported the findings from multiple experiments involving one or multiple samples that were examined under various conditions. The ‘pairing’ variable indicates which rows of the dataset represent a pairing of a read condition with one or multiple corresponding generate conditions within an experiment. A pairing may involve the same sample of subjects (when using a within-subjects design for comparing the conditions) or different samples (when using a between-subjects design)."],"concepts":["psychology"," memory"," proportions"," raw means"," multilevel models"," cluster-robust inference"],"note":[""],"source":["McCurdy, M.
