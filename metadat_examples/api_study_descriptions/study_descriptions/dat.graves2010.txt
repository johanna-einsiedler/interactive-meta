When untreated, mortality rates can be as highas 50-60%. Proper sanitation practices are usually effective inpreventing outbreaks, but a number of oral and injectable vaccineshave also been developed. The Cochrane review by Graves et al.(2010) examined the effectiveness of injectable vaccines forpreventing cholera cases and death. The present dataset includesresults from 17 studies that reported the number of cholera casesin vaccinated and placebo/comparison groups up to 7 months afterthe treatment."],"concepts":["medicine"," risk ratios"," Mantel-Haenszel method"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Graves, P.
