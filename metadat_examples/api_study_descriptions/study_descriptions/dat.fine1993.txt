Survival was assessed at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months in all but one study (which assessed survival only at 12 and at 24 months).  The data were reconstructed by Trikalinos and Olkin (2012) based on Table 2 in Fine et al. (1993) and Table 3 in Dear (1994). The data can be used to illustrate how a meta-analysis can be conducted of effect sizes reported at multiple time points using a multivariate model."],"concepts":["medicine"," oncology"," odds ratios"," longitudinal models"],"note":[""],"source":["Dear, K.
