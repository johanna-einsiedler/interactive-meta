In the controlled (two-arm) studies (studies 1-4), a cohortof patients in complete remission and potentially eligible for BMTwas assembled, and those who consented and for whom a donor couldbe found received BMT, with the remaining patients used ascontrols (receiving CMO). In the uncontrolled (one-arm) studies(studies 5-16), only a single group was studied, receiving eitherBMT or CMO.The data in this dataset were obtained from Table 1 in Begg andPilote (1991, p. 902)."],"concepts":["medicine"," oncology"," single-arm studies"," multilevel models"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1.
