{"id":["dat.michael2013"],"title":["The Non-Persuasive Power of a Brain Image"],"display_title":[""],"description":["Results from studies exploring how a superfluous fMRI brain imageinfluences the persuasiveness of a scientific claim."],"details":["The dataset contains the data from the meta-analysis by Michael etal. (2013) of experiments on the persuasive power of a brainimage. The meta-analysis analyzed an original study by McCabe andCastel (2008) as well as 10 replication attempts conducted by theauthors of the meta-analysis.In each study, participants read an article about using brainimaging as a lie detector. The article either included asuperfluous fMRI image of a brain (brain) or not (no_brain). Afterreading the article, all participants responded to the statement“Do you agree or disagree with the conclusion that brain imagingcan be used as a lie detector?” on a scale from 1 (stronglydisagree) to 4 (strongly agree).The original study by McCabe and Castel (2008) reported arelatively large increase in agreement due to the presence ofbrain images. Meta-analysis of the original study with the 10replications suggests, however, a small, possibly null effect: anestimated average raw mean difference of 0.07 points, 95% CI[-0.00, 0.14], under a random-effects model.In some studies, the article included a passage critiquing theprimary claims made in the article; this is coded in the‘Included_Critique’ column for analysis as a possible moderator.Note that Experiment 3 by McCabe and Castel (2008) was a 2x2between subjects design: brain image presence was manipulated aswell as the inclusion of a critique. The two different critiqueconditions are recorded as separate rows in this dataset. Analysisof this dataset with metafor yields the same results (givenrounding) reported in the manuscript."],"concepts":["psychology"," persuasion"," raw mean differences"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Michael, R.
