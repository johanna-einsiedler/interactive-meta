{"id":["dat.michael2013"],"title":["The Non-Persuasive Power of a Brain Image"],"display_title":[""],"description":["Results from studies exploring how a superfluous fMRI brain image influences the persuasiveness of a scientific claim."],"details":["The dataset contains the data from the meta-analysis by Michael et al. (2013) of experiments on the persuasive power of a brain image. The meta-analysis analyzed an original study by McCabe and Castel (2008) as well as 10 replication attempts conducted by the authors of the meta-analysis.  In each study, participants read an article about using brain imaging as a lie detector. The article either included a superfluous fMRI image of a brain (brain) or not (no_brain). After reading the article, all participants responded to the statement “Do you agree or disagree with the conclusion that brain imaging can be used as a lie detector?” on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree).  The original study by McCabe and Castel (2008) reported a relatively large increase in agreement due to the presence of brain images. Meta-analysis of the original study with the 10 replications suggests, however, a small, possibly null effect: an estimated average raw mean difference of 0.07 points, 95% CI [-0.00, 0.14], under a random-effects model.  In some studies, the article included a passage critiquing the primary claims made in the article; this is coded in the ‘Included_Critique’ column for analysis as a possible moderator. Note that Experiment 3 by McCabe and Castel (2008) was a 2x2 between subjects design: brain image presence was manipulated as well as the inclusion of a critique. The two different critique conditions are recorded as separate rows in this dataset. Analysis of this dataset with metafor yields the same results (given rounding) reported in the manuscript."],"concepts":["psychology"," persuasion"," raw mean differences"],"note":[""],"source":["Michael, R.
