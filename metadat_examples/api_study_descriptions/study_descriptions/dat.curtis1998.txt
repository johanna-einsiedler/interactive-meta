{"id":["dat.curtis1998"],"title":["Studies on the Effects of Elevated CO2 Levels on Woody Plant Mass"],"display_title":[""],"description":["Results from studies examining the effects of elevated CO2 levels on woody plant mass."],"details":["The studies included in this dataset compared the total above- plus below-ground biomass (in grams) for plants that were either exposed to ambient (around 35 Pa) and elevated CO2 levels (around twice the ambient level). The ‘co2.ambi’ and ‘co2.elev’ variables indicate the CO2 levels in the control and treatment groups, respectively (with the ‘units’ variable specifying the units for the CO2 exposure levels). Many of the studies also varied one or more additional environmental variables (defined by the ‘xtrt’ and ‘level’ variables):  • NONE = no additional treatment factor  • FERT = soil fertility (either a ‘CONTROL’, ‘HIGH’, or ‘LOW’ level)  • LIGHT = light treatment (always a ‘LOW’ light level)  • FERT+L = soil fertility and light (a ‘LOW’ light and soil fertility level)  • H2O = well watered vs drought (either a ‘WW’ or ‘DRT’ level)  • TEMP = temperature treatment (either a ‘HIGH’ or ‘LOW’ level)  • OZONE = ozone exposure (either a ‘HIGH’ or ‘LOW’ level)  • UVB = ultraviolet-B radiation exposure (either a ‘HIGH’ or ‘LOW’ level)  In addition, the studies differed with respect to various design variables, including CO2 exposure duration (‘time’), growing method (‘pot’: number = pot size in liters; ‘GRND’ = plants rooted in ground; ‘HYDRO’ = solution or aeroponic culture), CO2 exposure facility (‘method’: ‘GC’ = growth chamber; ‘GH’ = greenhouse; ‘OTC’ = field-based open-top chamber), and planting stock (‘stock’: ‘SEED’ = plants started from seeds; ‘SAP’ = plants started from cuttings). The goal of the meta-analysis was to examine the effects of elevated CO2 levels on plant physiology and growth and the interacting effects of the environmental (and design) variables."],"concepts":["ecology"," ratios of means"],"note":[""],"source":["Hedges, L.
