The effects ofusing such a modified calendar on student achievement have beenexamined in a number of studies and were meta-analyzed by Cooperet al. (2003).The dataset (taken from Konstantopoulos, 2011) contains theresults from 56 studies, each comparing the level of academicachievement in a group of students following a modified schoolcalendar with that of a group of students following a moretraditional school calendar. The difference between the two groupswas quantified in terms of a standardized mean difference (withpositive values indicating a higher mean level of achievement inthe group following the modified school calendar).The studies were conducted at various schools that were clusteredwithin districts. The data therefore have a multilevel structure,with schools nested within districts. A multilevel meta-analysisof these data can be used to estimate and account for the amountof heterogeneity between districts and between schools withindistricts."],"concepts":["education"," standardized mean differences"," multilevel models"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Konstantopoulos, S. (2011).
