(2003) examined a variety ofprognostic markers for overall and disease-free survival inpatients with neuroblastoma. One of the markers examined wasamplified levels of the MYC-N protein, with is associated withpoorer outcomes.The dataset given here was extracted from Riley (2011) and hasbeen used in several other publications (e.g., Riley et al., 2004,2007). The dataset provides the (log) hazard ratios (andcorresponding standard errors) with respect to these two outcomesin 81 studies, with positive values indicating a greater risk ofdeath (for OS) or disease recurrence/death (for DFS) for patientswith high MYC-N levels compared to those with normal/low levels.Note that information on both outcomes could only be extractedfrom 17 studies (39 studies only provided sufficient informationto extract the OS estimate, while 25 studies only allowed forextraction of the DFS estimate)."],"concepts":["medicine"," oncology"," hazard ratios"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Riley, R.
