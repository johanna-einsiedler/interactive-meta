(1985) on the effectiveness of of beta blockers for reducing mortality and reinfarction.  The article also describes what is sometimes called Peto's one-step method for meta-analyzing 2x2 table data. This method is implemented in the ‘rma.peto’ function."],"concepts":["medicine"," cardiology"," odds ratios"," Peto's method"],"note":[""],"source":["Yusuf, S., Peto, R., Lewis, J., Collins, R., & Sleight, P.
