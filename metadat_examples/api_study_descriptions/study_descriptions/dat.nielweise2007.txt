Anti-infective-treated catheters have been developed that are meant to reduce the risk of CRBSIs. Niel-Weise et al. (2007) conducted a meta-analysis of studies comparing infection risk when using anti-infective-treated versus standard catheters in the acute care setting. The results from 18 such studies are included in this dataset.  The dataset was used in the article by Stijnen et al. (2010) to illustrate various generalized linear mixed-effects models for the meta-analysis of proportions and odds ratios (see ‘References’)."],"concepts":["medicine"," odds ratios"," generalized linear models"],"note":[""],"source":["Niel-Weise, B.
