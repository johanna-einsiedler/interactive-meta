Patients were either treated with beta-blockers, endoscopic sclerotherapy, or with a nonactive treatment (control). Two trials included all three treatment conditions, 7 trials compared beta-blockers against control, and 17 trials compared sclerotherapy against control. The dataset has been used in various papers to illustrate methods for conducting a network meta-analysis / mixed treatment comparison."],"concepts":["medicine"," odds ratios"," Mantel-Haenszel method"," network meta-analysis"],"note":[""],"source":["Pagliaro, L., D'Amico, G., Sörensen, T.
