(2012) describe outreach or practice facilitation as a \"multifaceted approach that involves skilled individuals who enable others, through a range of intervention components and approaches, to address the challenges in implementing evidence-based care guidelines within the primary care setting\". The studies included in this dataset examined the effectiveness of practice facilitation interventions for improving some relevant evidence-based practice behavior. The effect was quantified in terms of a standardized mean difference, comparing the change (from pre- to post-intervention) in the intervention versus the comparison group (or the difference from baseline in prospective cohort studies)."],"concepts":["medicine"," primary care"," standardized mean differences"," publication bias"," meta-regression"],"note":[""],"source":["Baskerville, N.
