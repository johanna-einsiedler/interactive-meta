(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.  According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. But then ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these data indeed refer to the same control group). This appears contradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Anand, S.
