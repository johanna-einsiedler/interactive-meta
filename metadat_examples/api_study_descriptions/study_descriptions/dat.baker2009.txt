The primary outcome, occurrence of one or more episodes of COPD exacerbation, is binary (yes / no). For this outcome, five drug treatments (fluticasone, budesonide, salmeterol, formoterol, tiotropium) and two combinations (fluticasone + salmeterol, budesonide + formoterol) were compared to placebo. The authors considered the two combinations as separate treatments instead of evaluating the individual components."],"concepts":["medicine"," odds ratios"," network meta-analysis"," component network meta-analysis"],"note":[""],"source":["Baker, W.
