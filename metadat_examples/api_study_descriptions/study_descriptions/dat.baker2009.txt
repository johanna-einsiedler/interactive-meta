For this outcome, five drugtreatments (fluticasone, budesonide, salmeterol, formoterol,tiotropium) and two combinations (fluticasone + salmeterol,budesonide + formoterol) were compared to placebo. The authorsconsidered the two combinations as separate treatments instead ofevaluating the individual components."],"concepts":["medicine"," odds ratios"," network meta-analysis"," component networkmeta-analysis"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Baker, W.
