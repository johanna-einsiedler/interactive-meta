(1993),suggesting that magnesium is an effective treatment for reducingmortality. However, the results from the ISIS-4 mega trial (ISIS-4Collaborative Group, 1995) indicated no reduction in mortalitywith magnesium treatment. Publication bias has been suggested asone possible explanation for the conflicting findings (Egger &Davey Smith, 1995).The present dataset includes some additional trials and are basedon Table 18.2 from Egger, Davey Smith, and Altman (2001)."],"concepts":["medicine"," cardiology"," Peto's method"," publication bias"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Egger, M., Davey Smith, G., & Altman, D. G. (Eds.)
