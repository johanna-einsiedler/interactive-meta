The outcome measure for this meta-analysis was the standardized mean difference (with positive values indicating better performance in the healthy controls compared to the schizophrenia patients).  The dataset has a more complex structure for several reasons:  1. Studies 2, 3, 9, and 20 included more than one schizophrenia patient group and the standardized mean differences were computed by comparing these groups against a single healthy control group.  2. Studies 6, 12, 14, 15, 18, 19, 22, and 26 had the patients and controls complete different tasks of varying complexity (essentially the average number of moves required to complete a task). Study 6 also included two different task types.  3. Study 24 provides two standardized mean differences, one for men and the other for women.  4. Study 29 provides three standardized mean differences, corresponding to the three different COMT Val158Met genotypes (val/val, val/met, and met/met).  All 4 issues described above lead to a multilevel structure in the dataset, with multiple standardized mean differences nested within some of the studies. Issues 1. and 2. also lead to correlated sampling errors."],"concepts":["psychology"," standardized mean differences"," multilevel models"," multivariate models"," cluster-robust inference"," meta-regression"],"note":[""],"source":["Knapp, F., Viechtbauer, W., Leonhart, R., Nitschke, K., & Kaller, C.
