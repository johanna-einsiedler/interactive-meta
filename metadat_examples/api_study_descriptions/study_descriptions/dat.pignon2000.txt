For 65 trials, the dataset provides the observed minus expected number of deaths and corresponding variances in the locoregional treatment plus chemotherapy group. Based on these values, we can estimate the log hazard ratios with ‘OmE/V’ and the corresponding sampling variance with ‘1/V’.  The trials were also divided according to the timing of the chomotherapy: (1) adjuvant, after the locoregional treatment, (2) neoadjuvant, before the locoregional treatment, and (3) concomitant, chemotherapy given concomitantly or alternating with radiotherapy."],"concepts":["medicine"," oncology"," hazard ratios"],"note":[""],"source":["Pignon, J.
