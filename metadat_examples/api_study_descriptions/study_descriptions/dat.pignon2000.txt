For 65 trials,the dataset provides the observed minus expected number of deathsand corresponding variances in the locoregional treatment pluschemotherapy group. Based on these values, we can estimate the loghazard ratios with ‘OmE/V’ and the corresponding sampling variancewith ‘1/V’.The trials were also divided according to the timing of thechomotherapy: (1) adjuvant, after the locoregional treatment, (2)neoadjuvant, before the locoregional treatment, and (3)concomitant, chemotherapy given concomitantly or alternating withradiotherapy."],"concepts":["medicine"," oncology"," hazard ratios"],"note":["Strictly speaking, there are only 31 trials, since Breddin et al.(1980) and ATACS (1990) are multiarm trials.According to a correction, ‘dat.anand1999$ci[29]’ should be 1. Butthen ‘dat.anand1999$ci[21]’ would also have to be 1 (if these dataindeed refer to the same control group). This appearscontradictory, so this correction was not made."],"source":["Pignon, J.
