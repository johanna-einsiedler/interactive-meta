Of 43 articles identified, 30 articles (31 trials) were analyzed.\\nData Extraction Information on type, duration, and method of monitoring OA\\ntherapy, as well as rates of death, myocardial infarction (MI), thromboembolic com-\\nplications, stroke, and bleeding were abstracted by 2 independent observers.\\nData Synthesis With high-intensity (international normalized ratio [INR], 2.8-4.8) OAs\\nvs control (16 trials, 10 056 patients), clear reductions in mortality (odds reduction [ORed],\\n22%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 13%-31%), MIs (ORed, 42%; 95% CI, 34%-\\n48%), and thromboembolic complications including stroke (ORed, 63%; 95% CI, 53-\\n71%) were observed, but were associated with a 6.0-fold (95% CI, 4.4- to 8.2-fold)\\nincrease in major bleeding. For moderate OAs (INR, 2-3) vs control (4 trials, 1365 pa-\\ntients) the ORed for death was 18% (95% CI, −6% to 37%); for MI, 52% (95% CI,\\n37%-64%); and for stroke, 53% (95% CI, 19%-73%), but it increased bleeding by\\n7.7-fold (95% CI, 3.3- to 18-fold). For moderate- to high-intensity OAs (INR, (cid:36)2) vs\\naspirin (7 trials, 3457 patients), no reduction in death, MI, or stroke was observed, and\\nit was associated with a 2.4-fold (95% CI, 1.6- to 3.6-fold) increase in major bleeding.\\nFor moderate- to high-intensity OAs and aspirin vs aspirin alone (3 trials, 480 patients),\\nthe ORed for death, MI, or stroke was 56% (95% CI, 17%-77%) and major bleeding\\nincreased by 1.9-fold (0.6- to 6.0-fold). For low-intensity OAs (INR, (cid:44)2.0) and aspirin\\nvs aspirin alone (3 trials, 8435 patients), no significant reduction in death, MI, or stroke\\nwas observed, and major bleeding increased by 1.3-fold (95% CI, 1.0- to 1.8-fold).\\nConclusions Among patients with CAD, high-intensity and moderate-intensity OA\\nare effective in reducing MI and stroke but increase the risk of bleeding. In the pres-\\nence of aspirin, low-intensity OA does not appear to be superior to aspirin alone, while\\nmoderate- to high-intensity OA and aspirin vs aspirin alone appears promising and\\nthe bleeding risk is modest, but this requires confirmation from ongoing trials.\\n',\n",

Overall, no sig-\\nnificant heterogeneity was observed\\nconsistently across outcomes (TABLE 9).\\nCOMMENT\\nBased on this meta-analysis of random-\\nized trials that includes data from more\\nthan 21 319 patients, clear reductions in\\ntotal mortality, MI, and stroke occur\\namong CAD patients treated with OA at\\nhigh intensity (INR, 2.8-4.8). Although\\na significant increase in major bleeding\\nis also observed with high-intensity OA\\ntherapy, the benefits clearly outweigh the\\nrisks. By contrast, low-intensity OA (INR,\\n(cid:44)2.0) in the presence of aspirin is not\\nbeneficial, but increases bleeding. In a\\nrelatively smaller number of patients, we\\nanalyzed 3 categories of patients, mod-\\nerate OA vs control, moderate to high OA\\nvs aspirin, and moderate to high OA and\\naspirin vs aspirin alone. Moderate-\\nintensity OAs are more effective than con-\\ntrol in reducing recurrent ischemic\\nevents, moderate to high OA appear to\\nbe as effective but not superior to aspi-\\nrin (although small [10% to 15%] but\\nimportant differences between the thera-\\npies cannot be excluded), and some addi-\\ntional benefit appears to be gained when\\naspirin is added to moderate to high OA\\ncompared with aspirin alone. However,\\nthe CIs are wide and this hypothesis\\nrequires confirmation from other trials,\\nmany of which are ongoing.\\nThe trials included in this system-\\natic overview span a period of almost 40\\nyears.

As well,\\nthere is evidence to support the efficacy\\nof moderate intensity OA and aspirin\\ncompared with aspirin alone in patients\\nwith atrial fibrillation,56 and with me-\\nchanical valves.57 The additional bene-\\nfit of moderate OA when added to aspi-\\nrin in these trials is supportive of an in-\\ndependent mechanism of benefit of\\ncombinedantiplateletandantithrombotic\\ntreatment, but this requires confirma-\\ntion. Ongoing trials include WARIS-2,\\nASPECT-2, and CHAMP, which are\\nevaluating the efficacy of moderate-\\nintensity OA (INR, 2-3) and aspirin com-\\npared with aspirin alone in patients\\nfollowing unstable angina or MI.\\nThe risk of bleeding with OA is di-\\nrectly related to the intensity of anti-\\ncoagulation, clinical factors, the dura-\\ntion of therapy, and the concomitant\\nuse of antiplatelet therapies.13 In our\\nanalysis we observed an increase in the\\nabsolute rate of major bleeding with an\\nincrease in INR intensity (FIGURE 3).\\nNo significant heterogeneity was iden-\\ntified in a formal comparison of ORs\\nacross intensity strata. The highest rate\\nof bleeding was observed in the high-\\nintensity stratum, in which the moni-\\ntoring of anticoagulation was highly\\nvariable across studies, and the dura-\\ntion of treatment was significantly\\nlonger than in most modern trials. In\\nboth the low-intensity and moderate-\\nintensity strata, OAs were used in com-\\nbination with aspirin, however de-\\nspite this, a graded increase in bleeding\\nby INR intensity was observed. This\\nsuggests that in patients taking OAs, the\\nmore important predictor of bleeding\\nis the INR and not whether aspirin was\\nused concomitantly. However, at each\\nintensity the rates of major bleeding\\nwith OA were significantly higher than\\nin the comparison group (no OA or as-\\npirin alone), and this is a justifiable con-\\n',\n",

The reporting of\\nbleeding events was incomplete, and the\\ndefinitions of bleeding differed substan-\\ntially in the trials conducted prior to\\n1980. However, all trials reported the\\nrates of total bleeding, and wherever pos-\\nsible bleeds that required transfusion,\\nsurgical intervention, or hospitaliza-\\ntion were identified and coded as ma-\\njor bleeding events.\\nTrials conducted prior to 1980 pre-\\ndated the widespread use of the INR.12\\nIn trials that reported the prothrombin\\nratio and the type of thromboplastin\\nused, the INR was reasonably approxi-\\nmated using a validated nomogram.13 In\\n3 trials in which the thromboplastin was\\nnot reported, the intensity of anticoagu-\\nlation was classified based on the period\\nin which the study was conducted.10,14,15\\nAll INR classifications were indepen-\\ndently reviewed by a thrombosis expert\\n(Jack Hirsh, MD, September 1998).\\nAlthough a variety of OAs (eg, war-\\nfarin sodium, dicoumarol, marcoumar,\\nphenprocoumon, acencoumarin, bishy-\\ndroxycoumarin) were used across the\\ntrials, all agents work by inhibiting the\\nproduction of vitamin K-dependent co-\\nagulation factors (factors VII, IX, X, II),\\nand there are no data which suggest that\\nthe pharmacologic action of these agents\\ndiffer from one another.13\\nThe modified Mantel-Haenszel\\nmethod was used to combine the data\\nfrom individual trials.16 This method has\\nbeen extensively used in previous meta-\\nanalyses17 and entailed calculating the\\nobserved (number of events in the treat-\\nment group) minus the expected (aver-\\nage number of events for treatment and\\ncontrol groups) events and determin-\\ning the variance for each. Grand totals\\nwere calculated for each and the ratio of\\nthe 2 was used to estimate the odds ra-\\ntio (OR). The OR (and its 95% confi-\\ndence interval [CI]) was calculated for\\neach trial. The odds reduction (ORed)\\nwas calculated using 1 minus the OR,\\nand was expressed as a percentage. For\\neach study event, patients were counted\\nin each category (eg, a patient with fa-\\ntal MI was counted in the MI category\\nand in the total mortality category). For\\ncombined events (eg, death, MI, stroke),\\npatients were counted only once. In un-\\nevenly randomized trials in which fewer\\npatients were randomized to control, the\\nnumber of patients randomized (and\\nnumber of events reported) were ad-\\njusted to match the treatment group, us-\\ning methods previously described.16 Tri-\\nals were examined for heterogeneity by\\ndividing them into strata based on the\\nintensity of anticoagulation (low, mod-\\nerate, high) and the concomitant use of\\naspirin. The (cid:120)2 tests for heterogeneity\\nwere approximated by summing the N\\nseparate (cid:120)2 test statistics (O-E2/V) for\\neach trial and subtracting the overall (cid:120)2\\ndeath, MI or stroke, data from 13 tri-\\nals5,6,32,34-42,44 indicated an ORed of 43%\\n(95% CI, 37%-49%; P(cid:44).001; TABLE 5),\\nalthough a relative increase in total\\nand major bleeding occurred with OA;\\nOR of 4.7 (95% CI, 4.0-5.6; P(cid:44).001;\\nTABLE 6) and 6.0 (95% CI, 4.4-8.2;\\nP(cid:44).001; TABLE 7), respectively. In the\\n3 trials (N = 5496)5,6,41 in which hem-\\norrhagic stroke could be reliably sepa-\\nrated from total stroke, a 5-fold (95%\\nCI, 2.6-10.3; P(cid:44).001) relative in-\\ncrease in hemorrhagic strokes with OA\\nwas observed, although the absolute\\nrates were low (1.1% vs 0.1%). How-\\never, given the substantial ORed reduc-\\ntion in nonhemorrhagic strokes of 65%\\n(95% CI, 52%-74%; P(cid:44).001), overall,\\nthere was a 46% reduction (95% CI,\\n28%-59%; P(cid:44).001) in stroke with OA\\n(TABLE 8).

These results suggest that the underlying mecha-\\nnism causing autonomic disorders may differ pathophysiologi-\\ncally between PD and MSA. In the present study, diagnosis of\\nPD and MSA was based on clinical features and not on patho-\\nlogical findings. Therefore, the final diagnosis may be differ-\\nent when a postmortem study is performed. However, cardiac\\nI-123 MIBG accumulation may be a useful marker in differen-\\ntiating PD from MSA.\\ncontrolled trials testing OA at varying in-\\ntensities with or without concomitant as-\\npirin therapy. Initially, trials tested high-\\nintensity OA (international normalized\\nratio [INR], 2.8-4.8) in the absence of\\naspirin,5,6 or high- and moderate-\\nintensity OA (INR, 2-3) compared with\\naspirin or control.7 More recent trials\\nhave evaluated the combination of OA\\nand aspirin vs aspirin alone in the mod-\\nerate-intensity (INR, 2-3), and low-\\nintensity (INR, (cid:44)1.5)8,9 ranges. To more\\nreliably determine the role of OA with\\nand without antiplatelet therapy, we con-\\nducted an overview of all available tri-\\nals of OA in established coronary ar-\\ntery disease (CAD), stratified by intensity\\n(target INR) and by aspirin use. Our ob-\\njectives were to comprehensively as-\\nsess the effects of OA on death, recur-\\nrent MI, stroke, and bleeding in patients\\nwith established CAD, and to deter-\\nmine if the effects vary by intensity of\\nOA and aspirin use.\\nMETHODS\\nWe tried to identify all unconfounded\\nrandomized trials between 1960 and\\nJuly 1999 by searching the conven-\\nt i o n a l d a t a b a s e s o f M E D L I N E ,\\nEMBASE, and CURRENT CONTENTS,\\nreviewing reference lists, and inquir-\\ning with experts in the field, and phar-\\nmaceutical companies. Computer\\nsearches used combinations of key\\nwords related to OA (eg, warfarin so-\\ndium, coumarins) and vascular dis-\\nease (eg, CAD, MI, unstable angina,\\ncoronary artery bypass graft surgery).\\nStudies were included if they (1) were\\npublished after 1960, (2) were random-\\nized, (3) recruited patients with estab-\\nlished CAD, (4) used OA, and (5) con-\\ntinued treatment for 3 or more months.\\nData were extracted from the pub-\\nlished reports independently by 2 re-\\nviewers and a consensus was achieved\\nfor any discrepancies. Extra informa-\\ntion was requested from 2 trials,10,11 but\\nonly obtained for 1 trial.10\\nThe reported events of death, MI, and\\nstroke were taken from the published re-\\nports.

Of 43 articles identified, 30 articles (31 trials) were analyzed.\\nData Extraction Information on type, duration, and method of monitoring OA\\ntherapy, as well as rates of death, myocardial infarction (MI), thromboembolic com-\\nplications, stroke, and bleeding were abstracted by 2 independent observers.\\nData Synthesis With high-intensity (international normalized ratio [INR], 2.8-4.8) OAs\\nvs control (16 trials, 10 056 patients), clear reductions in mortality (odds reduction [ORed],\\n22%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 13%-31%), MIs (ORed, 42%; 95% CI, 34%-\\n48%), and thromboembolic complications including stroke (ORed, 63%; 95% CI, 53-\\n71%) were observed, but were associated with a 6.0-fold (95% CI, 4.4- to 8.2-fold)\\nincrease in major bleeding. For moderate OAs (INR, 2-3) vs control (4 trials, 1365 pa-\\ntients) the ORed for death was 18% (95% CI, −6% to 37%); for MI, 52% (95% CI,\\n37%-64%); and for stroke, 53% (95% CI, 19%-73%), but it increased bleeding by\\n7.7-fold (95% CI, 3.3- to 18-fold). For moderate- to high-intensity OAs (INR, (cid:36)2) vs\\naspirin (7 trials, 3457 patients), no reduction in death, MI, or stroke was observed, and\\nit was associated with a 2.4-fold (95% CI, 1.6- to 3.6-fold) increase in major bleeding.\\nFor moderate- to high-intensity OAs and aspirin vs aspirin alone (3 trials, 480 patients),\\nthe ORed for death, MI, or stroke was 56% (95% CI, 17%-77%) and major bleeding\\nincreased by 1.9-fold (0.6- to 6.0-fold). For low-intensity OAs (INR, (cid:44)2.0) and aspirin\\nvs aspirin alone (3 trials, 8435 patients), no significant reduction in death, MI, or stroke\\nwas observed, and major bleeding increased by 1.3-fold (95% CI, 1.0- to 1.8-fold).\\nConclusions Among patients with CAD, high-intensity and moderate-intensity OA\\nare effective in reducing MI and stroke but increase the risk of bleeding. In the pres-\\nence of aspirin, low-intensity OA does not appear to be superior to aspirin alone, while\\nmoderate- to high-intensity OA and aspirin vs aspirin alone appears promising and\\nthe bleeding risk is modest, but this requires confirmation from ongoing trials.\\no\\ni\\nt\\na\\nR\\nm\\nu\\nn\\ni\\nt\\ns\\na\\nd\\ne\\nM\\n-\\no\\nt\\n-\\nt\\nr\\na\\ne\\nH\\n', metadata={'heading': 'intensity OA (INR, 1.5-2.0) used to-\\ngether with aspirin, and this question\\nrequires further evaluation.\\nIn contrast to the low-intensity strata,\\nseveral small trials in which moderate-\\nintensity OA and aspirin in patients with\\nunstable angina or non-Q wave MI have\\nsuggested a moderate benefit51,53 when\\ncompared with aspirin alone. As well,\\nthere is evidence to support the efficacy\\nof moderate intensity OA and aspirin\\ncompared with aspirin alone in patients\\nwith atrial fibrillation,56 and with me-\\nchanical valves.57 The additional bene-\\nfit of moderate OA when added to aspi-\\nrin in these trials is supportive of an in-\\ndependent mechanism of benefit of\\ncombinedantiplateletandantithrombotic\\ntreatment, but this requires confirma-\\ntion. Ongoing trials include WARIS-2,\\nASPECT-2, and CHAMP, which are\\nevaluating the efficacy of moderate-\\nintensity OA (INR, 2-3) and aspirin com-\\npared with aspirin alone in patients\\nfollowing unstable angina or MI.\\nThe risk of bleeding with OA is di-\\nrectly related to the intensity of anti-\\ncoagulation, clinical factors, the dura-\\ntion of therapy, and the concomitant\\nuse of antiplatelet therapies.13 In our\\nanalysis we observed an increase in the\\nabsolute rate of major bleeding with an\\nincrease in INR intensity (FIGURE 3).\\nNo significant heterogeneity was iden-\\ntified in a formal comparison of ORs\\nacross intensity strata. The highest rate\\nof bleeding was observed in the high-\\nintensity stratum, in which the moni-\\ntoring of anticoagulation was highly\\nvariable across studies, and the dura-\\ntion of treatment was significantly\\nlonger than in most modern trials. In\\nboth the low-intensity and moderate-\\nintensity strata, OAs were used in com-\\nbination with aspirin, however de-\\nspite this, a graded increase in bleeding\\nby INR intensity was observed. This\\nsuggests that in patients taking OAs, the\\nmore important predictor of bleeding\\nis the INR and not whether aspirin was\\nused concomitantly.

This result\\nmay seems at odds with the recent re-\\nsults of the Thrombosis Prevention Trial\\nin which low-intensity OA and aspirin\\nwere evaluated in the primary preven-\\ntion setting and resulted in a significant\\nreduction in coronary death and MI.55 In\\nthis trial, 1268 patients were random-\\nized to OA alone, 1268 to aspirin alone,\\n1277 to OA and aspirin, and 1272 to pla-\\ncebo. The mean INR in the OA group\\nwas 1.47 with an average dose of 4 mg/\\nday. The combined treatment of OA and\\naspirin was found to be significantly more\\neffective than placebo, and a modest but\\nnonsignificant 15.5% risk reduction com-\\npared with aspirin was observed. In the\\nPost-Coronary Artery Bypass Graft trial,9\\nthe risk reduction with OA and aspirin\\ncompared with aspirin was modest and\\nnonsignificant (11%), and a similar dos-\\ning schedule and mean INR of 1.4 was\\nobtained. However, in the CARS trial,8\\nunlike the other 2, a fixed-dose regi-\\nmen (3 mg/day) was used and a target\\nINR intensity was not chosen.

Dis-\\ncontinuation rates were reported\\ninconsistently across the trials. The av-\\nerage rate of noncompliance with OA for\\nhigh intensity was 32% (95% CI, 30.6-\\n33.4), for moderate intensity was 20.0%\\n(95% CI, 18.0-22.0), and for low inten-\\nsity was 22.0% (95% CI, 19.1-24.9 )\\n(Table 1). The major reason for discon-\\ntinuation was concern about bleeding.\\nExploring Heterogeneity\\nWe detected a significant degree of het-\\nerogeneity in the high-intensity vs con-\\ntrol strata. Many of the trials included in\\nthis strata were small and were con-\\nducted in the early 1960s and 1970s;\\nhowever, after 1980, 3 large and well-\\ncontrolled trials testing high-intensity OA\\nwere conducted.5,6,41 To explore the\\ncauses of heterogeneity in the high-\\nintensity strata, we divided all high-\\nintensity trials into pre-1980 and post-\\n1980 groups. Most of the variation in the\\ntreatment effect across individual trials\\nwas derived from the small, older trials\\nin which the ORs vary from as small as\\n0.19 to as large as 8.6, compared with the\\nmodern trials in which the ORs are simi-\\nlar, and the variances smaller (available\\nfrom authors on request). Therefore,\\ngiven that the summary estimates of the\\nmodern trials are significant, not heter-\\nogeneous, and are consistent with the\\noverall conclusions of the treatment ef-\\nfect in favor of high-intensity OA, the\\noverall estimates are likely valid.\\nska K.

Three comparison groups were\\ndefined: trials that compared OA with\\ncontrol, trials that compared OA with\\naspirin, and trials in which the combi-\\nnation of OA and aspirin were com-\\npared with aspirin. Within each com-\\nparison group, strata were defined by\\nlevel of intensity (high, moderate, and\\nlow) and compared for the outcome of\\ndeath, MI, and bleeding. Overall, no sig-\\nnificant heterogeneity was observed\\nconsistently across outcomes (TABLE 9).\\nCOMMENT\\nBased on this meta-analysis of random-\\nized trials that includes data from more\\nthan 21 319 patients, clear reductions in\\ntotal mortality, MI, and stroke occur\\namong CAD patients treated with OA at\\nhigh intensity (INR, 2.8-4.8). Although\\na significant increase in major bleeding\\nis also observed with high-intensity OA\\ntherapy, the benefits clearly outweigh the\\nrisks. By contrast, low-intensity OA (INR,\\n(cid:44)2.0) in the presence of aspirin is not\\nbeneficial, but increases bleeding. In a\\nrelatively smaller number of patients, we\\nanalyzed 3 categories of patients, mod-\\nerate OA vs control, moderate to high OA\\nvs aspirin, and moderate to high OA and\\naspirin vs aspirin alone. Moderate-\\nintensity OAs are more effective than con-\\ntrol in reducing recurrent ischemic\\nevents, moderate to high OA appear to\\nbe as effective but not superior to aspi-\\nrin (although small [10% to 15%] but\\nimportant differences between the thera-\\npies cannot be excluded), and some addi-\\ntional benefit appears to be gained when\\naspirin is added to moderate to high OA\\ncompared with aspirin alone.
